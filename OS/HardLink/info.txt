iroot@beaglebone:/tmp# echo "testing links" >> test.txt

root@beaglebone:/tmp# more softlink
softlink: No such file or directory
You can see that when the test.txt fi le is moved to the subdirectory, the soft
link breaks but the hard link still works perfectly. Therefore, symbolic links
are not updated when the linked fi le is moved, but hard links always refer to
the source, even if moved or removed. Just to illustrate the last point, the fi le
test.txt can be removed using the following:
root@beaglebone:/tmp# rm subdirectory/test.txt
root@beaglebone:/tmp# more hardlink
testing links
